# Vending-machine

### General Information

The aim of this project was to create a simple vending machine application using java's graphic user interface.

My goal was to learn and understand elements that are used in building simple GUIs and how to implement them.

__Project Description__

The program mimics the operations of vending machines. More specifically, th eprogram simulatess what happenss when the user chooses one of the vending machine snacks, inputs money and gets change back or in the case of card payment, some little processing time. 

Created the graphics user interface by making subclasses of Java Swing Buttons, Labels, Frames and Listeners clsses. Also created classes for the products which were organized, managed, and stored in a Binary Search Tree format for efficient access and modification to the classes

### Example of the GUI

The front page

We can make a selection based on the options on the Right, for example this chooses Lays Classic(A1)

It shows the price and gives an option whether to proceed or not

It then requires to select whether you are paying cash or credit, this is the cash selection. It is initialized with 20 nickles, 10 dimes and 14 quarters

It then requires to select whether you are paying cash or credit, this is the credit selection, it accepts the payment or declines it after some time has passed
